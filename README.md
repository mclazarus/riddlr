# riddlr

## Introduction

I came up with a quick idea to have fun with a discord bot and also to
play with chatGPT so I had the robot write me a robot that will riddle
a discord channel daily with random wikipedia articles and keep score.

As long as I'm interested this will improve over time otherwise you
may just find it mostly abandoned. I'll probably apply a very simple
and non restrictive licesne to it when I think about it.
